### Completion Summary

This step successfully implemented the main genetic algorithm loop in `src/server/services/timetableGenerator/algorithm.ts`. This file acts as the central orchestrator, bringing together all the individual components from Phase 1 and 2 to create a functional evolutionary process.

The implementation of the `runGA` function follows the classic genetic algorithm flow:

1.  **Initialization**: Creates an initial population using the hybrid (heuristic and random) strategy from `initialization.ts`.
2.  **Evaluation**: Assesses the fitness of the initial population using the `evaluatePopulation` function.
3.  **Evolutionary Loop**: Iterates for a configured number of generations, performing the following steps in each cycle:
    - **Selection**: Selects parents from the current population using tournament selection.
    - **Crossover**: Creates new offspring by combining genetic material from selected parents.
    - **Mutation**: Introduces small, random variations into the offspring to maintain diversity.
    - **Replacement**: Forms the next generation by combining the best individuals (elites) from the current population with the newly created offspring.
4.  **Termination**: The loop includes conditions to terminate if the maximum number of generations is reached, or if the fitness of the best solution does not improve for a specified number of generations (stagnation).

An integration test suite (`algorithm.test.ts`) was also created to validate the main loop's functionality. This involved creating mock data and configurations to test the loop's execution, termination conditions, and overall correctness. Several bugs were identified and fixed during this testing process, including incorrect function calls, argument mismatches, and flawed data structures in the tests themselves. After a few iterations of debugging, all tests now pass, confirming that the core GA loop is working as expected.
