**Status**: All three foundation steps completed successfully with zero TypeScript errors

## What Was Implemented

### Step 1.1: Core Data Types & Interfaces

**File**: `src/server/services/timetableGenerator/types.ts` (583 lines)

Created a comprehensive type system that serves as the foundation for the entire GA implementation. Key architectural decision: **Leveraged Prisma-generated types** rather than duplicating definitions, importing base types from `generated/prisma/client` and extending them only where GA-specific properties were needed.

**Key Type Categories Implemented**:

1. **Extended Input Entity Types**: GALecture, GATeacher, GASubdivision, GAClassroom, GASlot - all extend Prisma base types with relationship data needed for constraint checking

2. **Chromosome Representation**:
   - Gene interface with lectureEventId, lectureId, timeslotId, classroomId, isLocked, duration
   - Chromosome as Gene array
   - Population as Chromosome array
   - Direct encoding as specified in research Section 2

3. **Constraint Violation Types**:
   - HardConstraintType enum with 10 types (TEACHER_CLASH, SUBDIVISION_CLASH, ROOM_CLASH, etc.)
   - SoftConstraintType enum with 6 types (IDLE_TIME, DAILY_DISTRIBUTION, etc.)
   - HardViolation and SoftViolation interfaces with gene indices, severity/penalty, descriptions, entity IDs

4. **Fitness Evaluation Types**:
   - FitnessResult with totalPenalty, fitnessScore, isFeasible flags
   - Separate hardPenalty and softPenalty tracking
   - Violation arrays and counts for detailed reporting
   - ComparisonResult enum for tournament selection

5. **Performance Optimization Structures**:
   - LookupMaps interface with 14 different Map/Set structures for O(1) constraint checking
   - Includes teacherToLectures, subdivisionToLectures, unavailability sets, slot linearization maps, locked assignments

6. **Configuration Types**:
   - GAConfig with all tunable parameters from research Table 3
   - ConstraintWeights for hierarchical penalty system
   - DEFAULT_GA_CONFIG with empirically-grounded defaults (population=200, crossover=0.9, mutation=0.05, etc.)

7. **Runtime Tracking Types**:
   - GenerationStats for per-generation monitoring
   - ExecutionStats for overall run metrics
   - GAInputData container for all loaded entities and lookup maps

8. **Output Types**:
   - ScheduledEvent for decoded timetable entries
   - GeneratedTimetable with events, fitness, stats, timestamp
   - QualityMetrics for solution comparison

9. **Helper Types**:
   - PartialGAConfig for user overrides
   - ProgressCallback and CancellationCheck function types for async control

**Architectural Choices**:

- Used `import type` for non-enum types to avoid runtime imports
- Separated enum imports (HardConstraintType, SoftConstraintType) since they're used as values
- All Maps use string keys for consistent serialization/deserialization
- Lookup maps designed for mutation-heavy workloads (no copying on reads)

### Step 1.2: Data Transformation Layer

**File**: `src/server/services/timetableGenerator/dataLoader.ts` (548 lines)

Implemented complete data pipeline from Prisma database to GA-ready structures with comprehensive validation and O(1) lookup map construction.

**Core Functions Implemented**:

1. **loadTimetableData** (main entry point):
   - Parallel loading of all 5 entity types using Promise.all
   - Comprehensive validation of loaded data
   - Total events calculation (sum of lecture counts)
   - Lookup map construction
   - Returns complete GAInputData object

2. **Individual Entity Loaders**:
   - loadLectures: Includes lectureSubdivisions, lectureClassrooms, lectureSlots, subject with group, teacher
   - loadTeachers: Includes unavailable slots
   - loadSubdivisions: Includes unavailable slots (handles schema typo: "subdivsionUnavailables")
   - loadClassrooms: Includes unavailable slots
   - loadSlots: Ordered by day, number for consistent linearization

3. **validateInputData**:
   - Checks for empty entity arrays with actionable error messages
   - Validates lecture count > 0 and duration > 0
   - Warns about lectures with no subdivisions or allowed classrooms
   - Capacity utilization warning (alerts if >80% utilization)
   - All errors thrown are user-facing with clear remediation steps

4. **buildLookupMaps** (critical for performance):
   - **Teacher mappings**: teacherToLectures with expanded event IDs, teacherUnavailable as Sets
   - **Subdivision mappings**: subdivisionToLectures, subdivisionUnavailable, lectureToSubdivisions
   - **Classroom mappings**: classroomUnavailable, lectureToAllowedClassrooms (defaults to all if none specified)
   - **Event expansion**: Each lecture with count=N generates N unique event IDs (format: "lectureId-evt0", "lectureId-evt1", etc.)
   - **Slot linearization**: slotIdToSlot, slotLinearization (id→index), linearToSlotId (index→id)
   - **Locked assignments**: Pre-assigned slots from LectureSlot.isLocked
   - **Classroom capacity**: Placeholder default of 100 (schema doesn't have capacity field yet)

5. **Utility Functions**:
   - getSlotLinearIndex: Convert slot ID to array index
   - getSlotIdFromLinearIndex: Reverse lookup
   - areSlotsConsecutive: Check if two slots are same day, consecutive periods
   - getConsecutiveSlots: Return array of N consecutive slots starting from given slot, or null if impossible

**Key Implementation Details**:

- Event expansion happens during lookup map construction for efficiency
- Allowed classrooms defaults to "all classrooms" if lecture has no restrictions
- Unavailability stored as Sets for O(1) membership testing
- Slot linearization uses Maps for bidirectional O(1) lookup
- Handles locked slots with partial assignments (slot may be locked but classroom flexible)

**Performance Considerations**:

- Single pass through entities for map construction
- All lookups are O(1) via Map/Set
- Event expansion done once at load time, not during evolution
- Includes array methods (find, filter) cached in closures where appropriate

### Step 1.3: Constraint Checking Infrastructure

**File**: `src/server/services/timetableGenerator/constraints.ts` (833 lines)

Implemented all 10 hard constraints and 5 soft constraints with hierarchical fitness evaluation following research Section 1.2.

**Hard Constraint Checkers** (all return HardViolation[]):

1. **checkTeacherClash**: Groups genes by slot, then by teacher within each slot. O(n) time complexity.

2. **checkSubdivisionClash**: Groups by slot, then subdivisions. Handles multi-subdivision lectures correctly.

3. **checkRoomClash**: Groups by (slot, classroom) composite key. Detects double-booking.

4. **checkTeacherUnavailability**: O(n) linear scan with O(1) Set lookup per gene.

5. **checkSubdivisionUnavailability**: Checks all subdivisions for each lecture event.

6. **checkRoomUnavailability**: Single O(1) lookup per gene.

7. **checkRoomCapacity**: Placeholder implementation (schema lacks enrollment data).

8. **checkAllowedClassroom**: Validates against lectureToAllowedClassrooms map. Empty allowed list means "all allowed".

9. **checkConsecutiveSlots**: For multi-duration lectures, validates consecutive periods exist. Checks same day + sequential period numbers.

10. **checkLockedSlots**: Validates locked assignments haven't been modified. High severity (10).

**Soft Constraint Checkers** (all return SoftViolation[]):

1. **checkIdleTime**: Calculates gaps between first and last class per subdivision per day. Penalty = number of idle slots.

2. **checkDailyDistribution**: Measures variance in lectures-per-day for each lecture type. Penalty proportional to variance (threshold: 1.0).

3. **checkTeacherDailyLimit**: Checks if teacher exceeds dailyMaxHours on any day. Penalty = excess hours.

4. **checkTeacherWeeklyLimit**: Checks weekly total vs weeklyMaxHours. Penalty = 2x excess (higher weight).

5. **checkConsecutivePreference**: Detects >3 consecutive teaching periods. Penalty = periods beyond 3.

**Master Evaluation Function**:

**evaluateChromosome**:

- Calls all 10 hard checkers + 5 soft checkers
- Calculates hardPenalty = violations × hardConstraintWeight (default 1000)
- Calculates softPenalty using type-specific weights from config
- Returns comprehensive FitnessResult
- Performance: All constraint checks use pre-grouped data to avoid O(n²)

**compareChromosomes**:

- Implements hierarchical comparison from research Section 3.2
- Rule 1: Feasible > Infeasible
- Rule 2: Among feasible, lower soft penalty wins
- Rule 3: Among infeasible, fewer hard violations wins
- Rule 4: Tie-breaker on total penalty
- Returns 1 (first better), -1 (second better), 0 (equal)

**Performance Optimizations**:

- Pre-grouping by slot reduces clash detection from O(n²) to O(n)
- All unavailability checks use Set.has() for O(1) lookup
- Consecutive slot validation uses Map lookups, not array scans
- No unnecessary object allocations in hot paths

**TypeScript Error Resolution**:

- Fixed enum imports (removed `import type` for enums used as values)
- Added undefined checks for array accesses
- Fixed string split() results with proper null checking
- All 41 initial errors resolved to zero errors

## Architectural Decisions Made

1. **Type Reuse Over Duplication**: Imported Prisma types as foundation, extended only where GA needs differ from persistence schema

2. **Event ID Format**: Chosen `${lectureId}-evt${index}` for uniqueness and debuggability

3. **Lookup Map Strategy**: All Maps use string keys (not objects) for serialization compatibility and memory efficiency

4. **Constraint Grouping**: Pre-group genes by slot/teacher/subdivision to achieve linear time complexity for clash detection

5. **Default Behaviors**:
   - Empty allowed classrooms = all classrooms allowed
   - Missing capacity = default 100
   - Locked slots validated separately with high penalty

6. **Error Handling Philosophy**: User-facing errors are actionable (e.g., "No lectures found" vs technical stack traces)

## Files Created

1. `src/server/services/timetableGenerator/types.ts` - 583 lines
2. `src/server/services/timetableGenerator/dataLoader.ts` - 548 lines
3. `src/server/services/timetableGenerator/constraints.ts` - 833 lines
4. `src/server/services/timetableGenerator/index.ts` - 26 lines (exports)

**Total**: 1,990 lines of production TypeScript code

## Files Modified

1. `src/server/trpc/routers/generateRouter.ts` - Commented out TimetableGenerator import temporarily with TODO markers

## Validation Results

- **TypeScript Compilation**: ✅ Zero errors in generator module
- **Type Safety**: ✅ All function signatures properly typed
- **Import Structure**: ✅ Correct separation of type vs value imports
- **Null Safety**: ✅ All potential undefined accesses guarded
- **Export Consistency**: ✅ All modules exported through index.ts

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

1. **Classroom Capacity**: Schema doesn't include capacity field - using placeholder value 100
2. **Subdivision Size**: Schema doesn't track enrollment - capacity checking incomplete
3. **Cognitive Load**: Not yet integrated (exists in separate module)
4. **Room Features**: Not in schema - using allowed classroom list as proxy
5. **Performance**: Not yet profiled with real data - optimization opportunities may exist

## Dependencies for Next Steps

The foundation is now complete for implementing Phase 2 (GA Core Components):

- **Step 2.1 (Fitness Function)**: Can use evaluateChromosome and compareChromosomes directly
- **Step 2.2 (Population Initialization)**: Has Gene and Chromosome types, needs random/heuristic generators
- **Step 2.3 (Selection)**: Has compareChromosomes for tournament selection
- **Step 2.4 (Crossover)**: Has Chromosome type and constraint evaluation for repair
- **Step 2.5 (Mutation)**: Has lookup maps for valid timeslot/classroom selection
- **Step 2.6 (Elitism)**: Has FitnessResult for sorting

All required data structures, types, and utility functions are now available for the evolution operators.
