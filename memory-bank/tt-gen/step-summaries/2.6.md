### Completion Summary

This step implemented the elitism and population replacement strategy, a critical component for ensuring the genetic algorithm's progress. The core logic is encapsulated in the `performReplacement` function within the new `replacement.ts` file.

The implementation correctly identifies and preserves the top-performing individuals (elites) from the current generation, guaranteeing that the best solution found is never lost between generations (monotonic improvement). The number of elites is determined by the `elitismRate` in the GA configuration.

A `selectElites` helper function was created to handle the sorting of the population based on the hierarchical fitness criteria: feasibility is prioritized, followed by hard penalty, and then soft penalty. This ensures that the most viable solutions are always selected as elites.

The new generation is constructed by combining these elites with the offspring produced by the crossover and mutation operators. The function also includes safeguards to maintain a constant population size.

A comprehensive test suite (`replacement.test.ts`) was developed to validate the logic, covering various elitism rates (including 0% and 100%), correct ranking based on fitness, and edge cases like insufficient offspring. All tests passed, confirming the reliability of the implementation.
