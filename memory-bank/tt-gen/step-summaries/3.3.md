# Step 3.3 Completion Summary: Result Persistence and Job Management

**Completed**: 2025-10-30
**Status**: âœ… Complete

## Overview

This step successfully integrated the entire Genetic Algorithm engine with the application's existing job infrastructure. A new `jobManager.ts` module was created to orchestrate the asynchronous execution of timetable generation, and the corresponding tRPC router (`generateRouter.ts`) was updated to trigger these jobs.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Job Management Module (`jobManager.ts`)

A comprehensive module was created to handle the entire lifecycle of a generation job.

- **Asynchronous Execution**: The main `executeGenerationJob` function runs the GA in the background, immediately returning control to the API caller. It wraps the entire process in a try/catch block to ensure robust error handling.
- **Status & Progress Updates**: The module updates the `Job` status in the Prisma database (`PENDING` -> `IN_PROGRESS` -> `COMPLETED`/`FAILED`/`CANCELLED`). A progress callback passed to the GA engine allows for real-time progress reporting.
- **Result Persistence**: On successful completion, the `persistResults` function saves the generated timetable by deleting the old `LectureSlot` records and creating new ones from the best chromosome found by the GA. This is done within a Prisma transaction to ensure atomicity.
- **Error Handling**: Any exception during the GA execution is caught, and the job status is updated to `FAILED` with a descriptive error message.
- **Cancellation Support**: The progress callback checks the job's status from the database, allowing a long-running generation to be gracefully terminated if a user cancels it.

### 2. tRPC Router Integration (`generateRouter.ts`)

The `generateRouter` was significantly refactored:

- The `start` mutation now creates a `Job` record and calls `executeGenerationJob` in a fire-and-forget manner, immediately returning the `jobId` to the client.
- The temporary "Not Implemented" logic was removed.
- The `cancel` mutation was corrected to set the job status to `CANCELLED` instead of `FAILED`.
- The `status` query was corrected to return the `result` JSON object directly without a redundant `JSON.parse` call.

### 3. Module Exports (`index.ts`)

The main index file for the `timetableGenerator` module was updated to export all the newly implemented functions and modules, providing a clean public API for the generator.

## Architectural Decisions

- **Fire-and-Forget Execution**: The decision to not `await` the `executeGenerationJob` in the tRPC router is crucial for a non-blocking API. This provides a responsive user experience, as the client is not stuck waiting for a long process.
- **Transactional Persistence**: Using `prisma.$transaction` for saving results is vital for data integrity. It prevents the database from being left in a corrupt state (e.g., old timetable deleted but new one not saved).
- **Centralized Orchestration**: The `jobManager.ts` module acts as a clean orchestration layer, separating the core GA logic from the concerns of job status and data persistence.
