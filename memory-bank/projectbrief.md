## 1. Project Overview

This document outlines the core requirements and goals for the Timetable Manager project. The aim is to develop a robust and user-friendly software solution that streamlines the creation, management, and optimization of timetables for educational institutes (e.g., schools, colleges, universities). It will provide powerful editing capabilities for manual adjustments and intelligent generation features to reduce administrative burden and improve resource utilization.

## 2. Core Requirements

### 2.1 Functional Requirements

*   **Timetable Generation:**
    *   Ability to generate new timetables based on user-defined constraints (e.g., subject-teacher availability, classroom capacity, curriculum structure, breaks).
    *   Support for various optimization goals (e.g., minimize teacher free periods, maximize classroom utilization, balance workload).
    *   Conflict detection and resolution during generation (e.g., two lectures assigned to the same classroom at the same time, teacher double-booked).
*   **Timetable Editing & Management:**
    *   Intuitive graphical interface for viewing, editing, and modifying existing timetables.
    *   Drag-and-drop functionality for reassigning lectures, teachers, and classrooms.
    *   Ability to add, delete, or modify individual timetable entries (class, teacher, classroom, time slot).
    *   Support for multiple timetable versions (e.g., draft, approved, historical).
    *   Search and filter capabilities (e.g., by teacher, subject, classroom, class).
*   **Data Management:**
    *   **Teachers:** Input and manage teacher profiles, including subjects taught, availability, and preferred working hours.
    *   **Subjects:** Input and manage subject details, including duration, required resources (e.g., lab, specific software).
    *   **Lectures/Batches:** Input and manage student groups/lectures, including their curriculum structure and assigned subjects.
    *   **Classrooms/Resources:** Input and manage available classrooms.
    *   **Time Slots:** Define and manage configurable time slots for lectures, breaks, and institute working hours.
*   **User Management & Permissions:**
    *   Define different user roles (e.g., Administrator, Teacher, Viewer).
    *   Assign appropriate permissions based on user roles (e.g., Admin can edit all, Teacher can only view their own timetable).
*   **Reporting & Export:**
    *   Generate printable reports of timetables (e.g., master timetable, teacher-specific, subdivisions-specific, classroom-specific).
    *   Export timetables in common formats (e.g., PDF, CSV, iCal).

### 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Usability:** Intuitive and user-friendly interface requiring minimal training.
*   **Performance:** Efficient generation of timetables, even with a large number of constraints and entities. Responsive UI for editing. Frontend using tanstack-db for this.
*   **Reliability:** Stable operation with robust error handling, especially during generation.
*   **Scalability:** Ability to handle a growing number of teachers, subjects, lectures, and classrooms without significant performance degradation.
*   **Security:** Protection of sensitive data (e.g., user credentials, personal teacher data).
*   **Maintainability:** Well-structured and documented codebase for easy future enhancements and bug fixes.
*   **Compatibility:** Web-based solution accessible from standard browsers.

## 3. Project Goals

### 3.1 Primary Goal

*   To provide an educational institute with a comprehensive, flexible, and efficient solution for managing and generating their academic timetables, significantly reducing the manual effort and time currently spent on this task.

### 3.2 Secondary Goals

*   To optimize resource utilization (teachers, classrooms) by generating timetables that adhere to constraints and potentially maximize efficiency.
*   To minimize scheduling conflicts and human errors inherent in manual timetable creation.
*   To improve communication and transparency regarding timetables across the institute.
*   To offer a customizable and adaptable platform that can cater to the diverse needs and rules of different educational institutions.
*   To provide a clear audit trail and version control for timetable changes.

## 4. Project Scope

### 4.1 In Scope

*   Core timetable generation engine.
*   Comprehensive data input and management for teachers, subjects, lectures, classrooms, and time slots.
*   Interactive web-based interface for viewing and editing timetables.
*   User authentication and role-based access control.
*   Basic reporting and export functionalities.

### 4.2 Out of Scope (for Initial Release)

*   Student-facing portals for personalized timetable viewing (will be considered for future phases).
*   Integration with existing student information systems (SIS) or learning management systems (LMS) â€“ initial focus on standalone functionality.
*   Advanced AI/ML-driven predictive scheduling or "what-if" scenario analysis (future enhancement).
*   Mobile-specific applications (web-responsive design will be prioritized).
*   Complex payroll or attendance tracking integrations.
